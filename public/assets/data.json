        "answer":"The Create-React-App is basically React with an integrated build system. It acts like a good boilerplate, so we don't need to set up Webpack, Babel, and other dependent packages to run React. Other than that, if you require extra functionalities such as routing, server-side rendering, you just need to add packages on top of Create-React-App. On the other hand, The Next.js is an open-source, lightweight full-stack React framework that comes bundled with an efficient build system, server-side rendering, routing, API routing, and many other awesome features that make the production environment easy."
